You are given an integer 𝑥.
You need to find the smallest non-negative integer 𝑦 such that the numbers 𝑥 and 𝑦
share at least one common digit. In other words, there must exist a decimal digit 𝑑
that appears in both the representation of the number 𝑥 and the number 𝑦.

Input
The first line contains an integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤1000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains one integer 𝑥
 (1≤𝑥≤1000).

Output
For each test case, output one integer 𝑦
 — the minimum non-negative number that satisfies the condition.

Example
Input:
5
6
96
78
122
696
Output:
6
6
7
1
6
Note
In the first test case, the numbers 6 and 6
 share the common digit '6'. Moreover, there is no natural number smaller than this that shares a common digit.

In the second test case, the numbers 6
 and 96
 share the common digit '6'.
