One can notice the following remarkable mathematical fact: the number 2025
 can be represented as (20+25)2.

You are given a year represented by a string 𝑠, consisting of exactly 4
 characters. Thus, leading zeros are allowed in the year representation. For example, "0001", "0185", "1375" are valid year representations.
 You need to express it in the form (𝑎+𝑏)2, where 𝑎
 and 𝑏
 are non-negative integers, or determine that it is impossible.

For example, if 𝑠
 = "0001", you can choose 𝑎=0, 𝑏=1, and write the year as (0+1)2=1.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤104) — the number of test cases.

The following lines describe the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string 𝑠, consisting of exactly 4 characters. Each character is a digit from 0 to 9.

Output
On a separate line for each test case, output:

Two numbers 𝑎 and 𝑏
 (𝑎,𝑏≥0) such that (𝑎+𝑏)2=𝑠, if they exist. If there are multiple suitable pairs, you may output any of them.
The number −1
 otherwise.
